INSTALLATION
============
1. copy this file to a directory which can be read by the webserver

2. THIS STEP SHOULDN'T BE NECESSARY ANYMORE!
    set webserver to treat .inc files as php:
	add "AddType application/x-httpd-php .inc" to /etc/apache2/conf.d/phpXY.conf 
	if the file cannot be found you can alternatively put it to the end of /etc/apache2/httpd.conf

3. create the database
	
	> mysql -u root -p
	> [input database root password]
	> create database [desired_arbs_databasename];
	> use [desired_arbs_databasename];
	> source [path_to_arbs]/INSTALL_DB.sql
	> grant all privileges on [desired_arbs_databasename].* to '[arbsuser]'@'[host_of_webserver]' identified by '[password]';
	> exit;	
	
4. edit the configuration
	edit [path_to_arbs]/default/config.inc.php 
	set at least the database connection variables in the first paragraph
	detailed configuration is explained in the Manual
5. set access rights
	chown -R [webserver username] [path_to_arbs]
	chmod +w [path_to_arbs]/default/cache.tmp  [path_to_arbs]/default/export.csv
	chmod -r [path_to_arbs]/default/history.xml   # this is to disallow users to read the history backup for it holds personal data of the users

7. another great feature of this tool is the ability to have lots of different instances of this script. To create another instance, 
   just copy the default instance (the folder named "default"), give the copy another name (for example "something") and change the config.inc.php 
   in this folder. After that, the new instance can be accessed by using "week.php?inctance=something" as URL. The used instance is then saved
   inside the session, so you just have to call such a link once.
